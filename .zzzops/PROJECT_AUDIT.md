# ZzzOps project policy audit

Status: complete. Reviewer: duy. Revision: 2.

## Evidence and decisions

- [x] `[policy:backend]` **Canonical goal backend** (applicable)
  - Decision: github_issues
  - Rationale: replace with capability evidence and repository identity
  - Sources: E-004: ZzzOps 2.1.0 init inspect — GitHub repository pixenetwork/jarvis-control-transport is usable with Issues enabled; initialization exact head is 616db009971a8b2422c60cb664b93ba3f9fa8bd8.
  - Confidence/default: medium; ZzzOps GitHub-only authority → changed
  - Provenance: customized from a ZzzOps default
  - Settings: `{"authority": "github_issues", "capability_evidence": "ZzzOps init inspect verified pixenetwork/jarvis-control-transport is usable with GitHub Issues enabled.", "fallback": "forbidden", "repository_identity": "pixenetwork/jarvis-control-transport", "tradeoffs": {"github_issues": "shared native issue queue requiring GitHub access"}}`
  - Exceptions: none
  - Unresolved: none
- [x] `[policy:git_review_release]` **Git, review, and release** (applicable)
  - Decision: Follow repository rules: one draft PR per source-changing writer lane; preserve exact-head discipline; re-fetch candidate head and current main before promotion; use human_at_exhaustion review without bypassing required PR, merge, or release authority.
  - Rationale: Preserves portfolio exact-head, one-writer, draft/review, and guarded-promotion governance.
  - Sources: E-001: README.md — Maintain a public, non-executable transport for bounded Jarvis Host Ops command envelopes while preserving strict separation from private source, credentials, receipts, and execution authority.; E-002: repository inspection — Repository exact main/head at initialization is 616db009971a8b2422c60cb664b93ba3f9fa8bd8; no existing .zzzops/POLICY.json or AGENTS.md was present in the clean clone.; E-003: Athena portfolio ZzzOps policy review approved by user — Use Agentic engineering rigor, Managed ZzzOps adherence, human_at_exhaustion review timing, one-writer ownership, exact-head discipline, approved local validation, receipts, and fail-closed safety boundaries.; E-004: ZzzOps 2.1.0 init inspect — GitHub repository pixenetwork/jarvis-control-transport is usable with Issues enabled; initialization exact head is 616db009971a8b2422c60cb664b93ba3f9fa8bd8.
  - Confidence/default: medium; ZzzOps exhaustion-time review fallback → changed
  - Provenance: customized from a ZzzOps default
  - Settings: `{"branch_base": "nearest_authorized_trunk", "child_target": "nearest_parent_branch", "commit_style": "conventional", "commit_unit": "verified_subgoal", "conversational_approval": "never_for_goal_progress", "dependency_base": "dependency_branch", "execution_branch": "per_goal", "merge_after_approval": "when_authorized", "multiple_dependency_base": "reviewed_base_containing_all", "parent_pseudo_trunk": true, "pr_approval": "required_when_repository_requires_pr", "pull_request_unit": "per_goal", "read_only_dependency_investigation": "allowed_before_completion", "review_gate": "human_at_exhaustion", "review_pending_dependency": "stack_from_reviewed_checkpoint", "review_state_reads_per_checkpoint": 1, "shared_pull_request": "explicit_reviewed_override"}`
  - Exceptions: none
  - Unresolved: none
- [x] `[policy:execution_continuation]` **Execution and work continuation** (applicable)
  - Decision: Continue across actionable goals under reviewed dependency and resource policy, and incorporate newly captured goals at the next safe checkpoint.
  - Rationale: reduces babysitting without forcing sequential work when bounded parallelism is safe
  - Sources: E-001: README.md — Maintain a public, non-executable transport for bounded Jarvis Host Ops command envelopes while preserving strict separation from private source, credentials, receipts, and execution authority.; E-002: repository inspection — Repository exact main/head at initialization is 616db009971a8b2422c60cb664b93ba3f9fa8bd8; no existing .zzzops/POLICY.json or AGENTS.md was present in the clean clone.; E-003: Athena portfolio ZzzOps policy review approved by user — Use Agentic engineering rigor, Managed ZzzOps adherence, human_at_exhaustion review timing, one-writer ownership, exact-head discipline, approved local validation, receipts, and fail-closed safety boundaries.; E-004: ZzzOps 2.1.0 init inspect — GitHub repository pixenetwork/jarvis-control-transport is usable with Issues enabled; initialization exact head is 616db009971a8b2422c60cb664b93ba3f9fa8bd8.

  - Exceptions: none
  - Unresolved: none
- [x] `[policy:verification_testing]` **Verification and testing** (applicable)
  - Decision: Require artifact-appropriate observable evidence on the exact candidate head using approved local/direct execution; GitHub Actions results are provenance only and never authoritative Jarvis validation.
  - Rationale: Preserves the portfolio ban on GitHub Actions execution/validation while requiring falsifiable evidence.

  - Exceptions: none
  - Unresolved: none
- [x] `[policy:deployment_resources]` **Deployment, environment, and resources** (applicable)

  - Exceptions: none
  - Unresolved: none
- [x] `[policy:workflow_adherence]` **ZzzOps workflow adherence** (applicable)

  - Exceptions: none
  - Unresolved: none
- [x] `[policy:automated_design]` **Automated design authority** (applicable)

  - Exceptions: none
  - Unresolved: none
- [x] `[policy:autonomy_approval_parallelism]` **Autonomy, approvals, and parallelism** (applicable)
  - Decision: Interview thoroughly during goal capture; execute unattended within reviewed authority; allow multiple writer lanes only when their file/resource scopes are explicitly non-overlapping; keep one writer per coherent surface; use up to three size-aware worktree workers.
  - Rationale: Matches ai-orchestrator one-writer-per-surface governance and repository size while preserving bounded parallel throughput.
